Cats and Dogs will not have specific classes identifying breed but are trained to recognize different breeds.

Lightsaber and Daleks color will not be specified but will be accounted for in training.

People will only be recognized when full body is shown. EX: A person holding a cat without their head or legs being shown should not recognize both cat and person but only the cat.
